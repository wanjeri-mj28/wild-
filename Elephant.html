        <h1>AFRICA SAVANNAH ELEPHANTS</h1>

        <P>African savannah elephants are found in 23 countries across Africa. They have large populations in Kenya, Botswana, Namibia, Tanzania, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The IUCN classifies the African savannah elephant as endangered. This means it is at a very high risk of extinction in the wild. Their numbers are also decreasing. These elephants are poached for their ivory and their natural habitats are being converted into agricultural land and infrastructure by expanding human populations. IFAW is working to protect African savannah elephants and conserve their remaining habitat through our Room to Roam initiative.</P>
